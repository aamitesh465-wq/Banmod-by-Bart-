Information
BanMod was created primarily to prevent "toxic" players from rejoining after the official Among Us ban. Unfortunately, the official Among Us ban wasn't enough and can be circumvented by changing the device's IP address or using a VPN!!!

Gradually, the mod has become increasingly complex and many more features have been added, always striving to keep it compatible with the official servers. For this reason, it has some limitations and annoyances (such as waiting to send messages).

Features
You can ban or kick disruptive players at any time, even during matches.
You can decide whether to share your lobby code, and other players with the mod can join by obtaining codes from the website https://banmod.online/
Immediately denies access to lobbies to players with names you have banned (Denyname.txt)
Immediately denies access to lobbies to players who are in the list (banList.txt) or to players who are blocked on Among Us
Kicks or bans those who use banned words or spam start, you can set from 0 to 5 allowed words before being kicked
You can color and add symbols to names
You can decide whether to kick or protect players who have been in the game for too long (Time and action can be set)
You can close the meetings and you can end the match if necessary
There are also some role enhancements or additions to Crewmates:
Enhancements or additions to Crewmates
The Crewmate who completes all tasks in the shortest time will become immortal and cannot be killed or voted on normally, but can be voted on and killed in meetings. The Engineer and the Guesser cannot become immortal.
The Imposter (only the Spectre) can kill the Immortal in meetings by guessing who they are, but if they guess incorrectly, they commit suicide.
The Engineer, when he completes all tasks, resolves active sabotage a set number of times by trapdooring (coms cannot be repaired).
The Guesser can kill Impostors in meetings by guessing who they are. If they guess incorrectly, they commit suicide.
The President (exiler) can forcefully expel (or kill) a player of his choice. If the target is not an impostor, there are no consequences. Crewmates and impostors can become President.
The Scientist will receive the actual time of the players' death.
